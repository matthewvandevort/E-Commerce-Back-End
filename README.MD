# Description:

Description of project: This project tasked me to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. I had to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

```

## Acceptance Criteria

* Uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the run-time functionality.

* Uses [Express](http://expressjs.com/)

* Uses [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) for the databases.

* Uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database 
```
# Installation
